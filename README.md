HTML Assignment

In this assignment, I became more familiar with coding images in HTML.
I learned how to format italics and use them appropriately.

While creating the different HTML webpages, I ran into an issue with pb and j being a .txt file instead of .html
I am unsure how that fixed itself.

I am still unfamiliar with git and knowing when/what to commit, but I feel confident that I will improve as I continue the Odin Project courses.
